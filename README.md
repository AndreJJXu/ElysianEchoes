# ElysianEchoes: A Music-Image Dataset for Emotional Cure

This repository contains open-source resources related to the paper **ElysianEchoes: A Music-Image Dataset for Emotional Cure**, which aims to explore the intersection of music, emotion, and visual imagery. The resources shared here include datasets, model weights, experimental setup details, and future experimental directions to further enrich the understanding of emotional healing through multimodal data.

The repository is organized as follows:

## Contents

1. **Dataset Annotation Methodology**
    - This section provides the details regarding how the **ElysianEchoes** dataset was annotated. We describe the process for labeling music tracks, images, and their associated emotions, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in dataset creation.

2. **Model Weights for BLIP-Aes and BLIP-Imp**
    - The pretrained model weights for two key models used in our work—**BLIP-Aes** and **BLIP-Imp**—are provided here. These models are designed to connect music, images, and emotional contexts for enhanced performance in the emotional cure task.

3. **ElysianEchoes Dataset**
    - The **ElysianEchoes** dataset itself is open-sourced here. It includes both the music tracks and associated images, each carefully labeled with emotional attributes. You can access the dataset files and use them for your own research or experimentation.

4. **Experimental Setup Details**
    - In this section, we offer detailed insights into the experimental setups used for our work with **ElysianEchoes**. This includes model configurations, training procedures, hyperparameters, and evaluation protocols used to assess the effectiveness of emotional cure models based on music-image relationships.

5. **Future Experiments and Directions**
    - A discussion of potential future experiments and directions is provided here. This includes suggestions for improving dataset diversity, refining emotional classifications, and exploring new model architectures for enhanced emotional interpretation through music and imagery.

## How to Use

To get started with the dataset and models, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the corresponding directories. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the README in each section of the repository. You can also find sample code to help with dataset loading, model inference, and running experiments.
